1. Before toString, what printed when you printed an object? Why?

2. List your class’s three fields and their default values before you set anything.

3. What changed after you added the default constructor? After adding the parameterized constructor?

4. Why add @Override to toString()?

5. Why is encapsulation (private fields + getters/setters) preferred over public fields? Give one concrete validation rule you could add to a setter.
